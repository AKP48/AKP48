AKP48 is an IRC bot written in JavaScript.

He likes taking long walks on the beach and stuff, I guess.

# Installation
1. Clone the code.
2. `npm install`.
3. Configure the bot by making a file named `config.json` that should be strikingly similar in structure and syntax to `example.config.json`.
4. `chmod 777 log`.
5. `node server.js`.
6. ???
7. PROFIT!

Made with <3 and donuts by AKP.
